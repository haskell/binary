-- Kolmodin 20100427: at zurihac we discussed of having partial take a
-- "Maybe ByteString" and implemented it in this way.
-- The reasoning was that you could accidently provide an empty bytestring,
-- and it should not terminate the decoding (empty would mean eof).
-- However, I'd say that it's also a risk that you get stuck in a loop,
-- where you keep providing an empty string. Anyway, no new input should be
-- rare, as the RTS should only wake you up if you actually have some data
-- to read from your fd.
