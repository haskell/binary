# binary package #

*Efficient, pure binary serialisation using lazy ByteStrings.*

The ``binary`` package provides Data.Binary, containing the Binary class,
and associated methods, for serialising values to and from lazy
ByteStrings. 
A key feature of ``binary`` is that the interface is both pure, and efficient.
The ``binary`` package is portable to GHC and Hugs.

## Building binary ##

To build binary you can run the following commands in the binary package folder.

    $ runhaskell Setup.lhs configure
    $ runhaskell Setup.lhs build
    $ runhaskell Setup.lhs install

If you have cabal installed you can also install the ``binary`` package using it.

    $ cabal install binary

If you have your cabal package database updated, it will download and install the last
version of ``binary`` released on Hackage.

## Using binary ##

First:

    import Data.Binary

and then write an instance of Binary for the type you wish to serialise.
An example doing exactly this can be found in the Data.Binary module.
You can also use the Data.Binary.Builder module to efficiently build
lazy bytestrings using the ``Builder`` monoid. Or, alternatively, the
Data.Binary.Get and Data.Binary.Put to serialize/deserialize using
the ``Get`` and ``Put`` monads.

More information in the haddock documentation.

## Deriving binary instances ##

It is possible to mechanically derive new instances of Binary for your
types, if they support the Data and Typeable classes. A script is
provided in tools/derive. Here's an example of its use.

    $ cd binary 
    $ cd tools/derive 

    $ ghci -fglasgow-exts BinaryDerive.hs

    *BinaryDerive> :l Example.hs 

    *Main> deriveM (undefined :: Exp)

    instance Binary Main.Exp where
      put (ExpOr a b) = putWord8 0 >> put a >> put b
      put (ExpAnd a b) = putWord8 1 >> put a >> put b
      put (ExpEq a b) = putWord8 2 >> put a >> put b
      put (ExpNEq a b) = putWord8 3 >> put a >> put b
      put (ExpAdd a b) = putWord8 4 >> put a >> put b
      put (ExpSub a b) = putWord8 5 >> put a >> put b
      put (ExpVar a) = putWord8 6 >> put a
      put (ExpInt a) = putWord8 7 >> put a
      get = do
        tag_ <- getWord8
        case tag_ of
          0 -> get >>= \a -> get >>= \b -> return (ExpOr a b)
          1 -> get >>= \a -> get >>= \b -> return (ExpAnd a b)
          2 -> get >>= \a -> get >>= \b -> return (ExpEq a b)
          3 -> get >>= \a -> get >>= \b -> return (ExpNEq a b)
          4 -> get >>= \a -> get >>= \b -> return (ExpAdd a b)
          5 -> get >>= \a -> get >>= \b -> return (ExpSub a b)
          6 -> get >>= \a -> return (ExpVar a)
          7 -> get >>= \a -> return (ExpInt a)
          _ -> fail "no decoding"
